 * Responsive layout facade for the Extent test split view.

 * side.  Its mobile rule intentionally moves the wrapper by the desktop
 * sidebar width, which leaves a 200px horizontal offset in a static report.
 * The report remains usable on a narrow viewport when the wrapper starts at
 * the viewport edge; the existing list/content transition still controls
 * which pane is visible.</p>
